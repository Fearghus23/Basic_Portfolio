        <h1>About me: Intro</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> I was born in 1993, grew up a few years in NYC before making the
            journey here to the forested state of Oregon. Raised in the smaller town of Eugene I was sort of the last
            generation of kids that grew up without cell phones and touch screens, coupled with the hippy nature
            promoted in the town I was content without. Spending a good amount of time outdoors I am an avid caver and
            hiker with a touch of survivalist, as silly as that sounds to some. It's a lot of fun to try and navigate
            with
            just a compass/ vague map of the topography. Aside from my interests in the 'natural' world, interests in
            technology for me are as natural as anything, captivating really. I didn't come from a place with much
            money, so my first laptop back in 2009, give or take a year or two, was truly a captivating object (though
            it was by no means a very fast device). as the internet grew I was always interested in the backround of how
            the web works and how it can be used for a freedom that only takes place in emerging sectors, before it can
            be coerced into more solid rules and forms. </p>

            <li>I love arts of all variety</li>
            <li>My fascination with the ocean is notable</li>
            <li>I was born the day after Christmas</li>
